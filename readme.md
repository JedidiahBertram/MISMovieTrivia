Jedidiah Bertram G45 Q1 project:
OBNOXIOUS YOUTUBE RIDDLE GAME

#############################################################

The only 'problem' this project has the potential of solving
is boredom. It's purely based in the land of humor, and fun.
It is direcrted at anyone with a sense of humor, a desire to
solve riddles, and a passion for pop culture/youtube videos.

The project is just for basic, stupid fun at it's most basic
level.

The challenge comes with the coding and logic it will take to
make the website function as I would like it to.

This app/web page will require a fair amount of input and inte-
activity from the user. They will initialize the game, and an-
swer riddles presented to them. This also requires an input of
a youtube API/playlist reference to generate the videos played.

The output will result in a video being played randomly, and co-
ntinuously, as well as a response when the user guessed correct-
ly or incorrectly.

This project will rely heavily on the YouTube API.

I'm not sure how to answer the technoligies question. I will
be usuing JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS to complete it.

Additional features wil include a timer, a frustrating false
close 'X' button, that moves when a user tries to click it,
among a myriad of other fun things here and there I can only
hope to include.
